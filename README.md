CPP-SIMBALLS
============
29/10/14
Test2.vcxproj is the first attempt to read data from Simballs "Joysticks". It detects this Joysticks but doesn't read the data.
It needs SimballConfig.exe and SimballMedicalHID.dll to be in the computer running this project.
SimballConfig.exe has to be running before running the project.
